Multiprocessor Assignment #1

Reporting:
	Hours: 2,5h

Installing Visual Studio 2019 and C/C++ compiler tools
	* They were already installed on my machine
Installing the SDK and support for AMD CPU (FX-8350) & AMD GPU (RX 580)
	* Downloaded the SDK: https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases/tag/1.0
	* The graphics card already had an OpenCL driver installed

The driver is located in C:\Windows\system32\OpenCL.dll (for 32-bit) and in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\OpenCL.dll (for 64-bit)

Linked libs and include directories thtough Visual Studio project configuration.

Ran examples with it to test it works. However, most if not all of the examples contained some deprecated function calls (e.g. clClearCommandQueue -> clClearCommandQueueWithProperties), which had to be changed to make the program work.
Apparently the examples are still in OpenCL 1.x or 2.x instead of 3.0, which is unfortunate.

Then I studied the OpenCL library a bit to get somewhat familiar with it.
